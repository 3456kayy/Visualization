<h1>Charting</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved analyzing sales and profitability data for multiple product categories, including bicycles, helmets, and electronic devices. Two datasets were utilized: one detailing year-over-year sales for bikes and accessories, and another focused-on profit margins for various DVD players. Conditional formatting was applied to create visual data representations, making it easier to compare product performance. Additionally, calculations were performed to determine total profit, profit per unit, and total cost, offering insights into financial performance. The analysis provided valuable data to support strategic decision-making and optimize sales approaches.
